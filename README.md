# architectGame
I want to learn how to use mouseListeners. I want to create an architect game where the user can create their own world. Like an artist creates from their pallete of colors, the user will be able to create through a menu. The menu will contain the object title, object image, and object button. The button will switch off between which object is going to be placed on the panel.
